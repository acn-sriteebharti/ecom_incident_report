Case 1 (simple)
Few users report slow loading of UI/website.

Date - DD/MM/YYYY
Impact - Low
Priority - Low

Teams Involved - Production Support, User

Description:
User called at HH:MM on DD/MM/YYYY to report lag on Device Listing Page. Helpdesk escalated the request to production support at HH:MM

Resolution:
[DD/MM HH:MM] - Asked user to check internet connection, clear cache and also to check browser compatibility.
[DD/MM HH:MM] - Issue was not resolved. Support team checked website performance report on AppDynamics UI. All utilizations were under thresholds with no spike. Load balancing was working as expected.
[DD/MM HH:MM] - Checked logs and identified few requests apis taking longer to get response back from the code base/db. Tried to reproduce the issue on remote and local machine. Issue not reproduced.
[DD/MM HH:MM] - Asked user for location, and then locally modified the location to match the user. Issue reproduced both in local and remote. API retrieving the device list is getting timed out.
[DD/MM HH:MM] - During debugging it was found to be a data setup issue for product available in user address/state.
[DD/MM HH:MM] - Since issue is not critical, created an incident for data setup team with details. Incident number -INCXXXXXXX.
[DD/MM HH:MM] - Incident marked as pending resolution - data team and downgraded.

Notes:
Advise dev team to add more logging for the product filtering logic in the code to capture issues.
